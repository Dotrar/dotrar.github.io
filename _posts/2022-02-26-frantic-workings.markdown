I've had a bit of a frantic run around recently; feeling not too comfortable in how I have organised myself and how I get things going week by week.

The main issues are with the bullet journal, and two main concerns:

1. Having to spend 5-15 mins every evening to lay out new structure or plan.
2. Not having a sufficient "Look ahead" version for "do X next week" or "do Y every Thursday."

From these issues, I can fight them and tweak my bullet journaling system to account for these issues, or I can just put them aside and look for something else instead. I've opted to go with the additional approach, and add a more structured, dated diary to my "stack" of journals.

While I could have created and tweaked a system in my bullet journal, I don't want to: I don't have the time and mental capacity to try and analyse and make margin for error when I get things wrong.

The appeal of just getting some structure and forcing myself into it is a little more attractive to me, because I do rely on external pressures to force me into doing something, It's not mandatory but it definitely helps. 

## Purchasing Diaries

Branching off from my usual Officeworks purchases, I've opted to go to [milligram](https://milligram.com) and I purchased a few week-to-a-view diaries that were on sale, as the diary season is over.

There's a few interesting takes, which have been much more fascinating to look at rather than my standard diary.

I'll write more about them, and post photos, when I get them, which I believe should be this coming Monday.

### Rollbahn Note Diary A5

### Moleskine Soft cover Weekly note diary 

### MiGoals Classic Weekly Diary

## Progress Journal

This was an interesting purchase as it doesn't fit the dated, weekly-view, approach that the others have. It's an undated 90-day diary to keep track of a specific goal. 

## Combination with bullet journal 

With the use of these *diaries* I'm intending to have these complement my *journal* which will devolve back down into a notebook of ideas, thoughts, and collections. Having the pages indexed means that I can point to each one from the other, which sounds very promising from the outset, but I'll have to see how it works.

I do enjoy the act of writing and processing thoughts this way. I do like writing in both this blog and the journaling; But it is getting a bit harder to do with having a pregnant wife around. I do recognise the need for a structured approach of the diary, but still have enough flexibility and "free-form" notes from the journal. Hopefully I can find a bit of a balance between the two.

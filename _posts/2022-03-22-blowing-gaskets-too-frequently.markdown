This is a post as a work in progress about how I can diagnose and attempt to resolve a personal issue that I have, it will probably not quite reach a completed state, but instead be worked on as I find new questions, answers, and structures in my thoughts. 

I had a bit of a spill last Friday that I'm affectionately calling "blowing a gasket". As with all retro/hindsight analysis, I could see this one building up to a point where I personally feel the need for "release" at the week's end: Friday afternoon is the socially acceptable time to have a drink and "unwind" but I tend to unwind rapidly and somewhat chaotically.

It's not the first time, there seems to be a repeated instance of this occurring in many different times in my life, and sometimes in my family's life as well (Sisters, Aunts, etc).

The issue, I feel, is the *"needing to unwind"* part; to imply that I was initially wound, and thus must let loose to get back to a balanced state. One scene I remember from the night was me actually coming to tears as I felt that my mind and thoughts were in a state of fluidity and that I could formulate ideas more willingly.

Looking at the situation for what it is, there's plenty of angles of attack that we can dissect this issue.

* **The needing to unwind** - am I wound during the week? What healthy habits could I take to unwind more during the week and not feel "built up" by the week's end?
* **Expressing thoughts fluidly** - Is it that I am just more vocal with my ideas while intoxicated? and being able to talk and command attention causes the ideas to flow and continue?
* **Chaotic unwinding** - "musing over a wine" is a regular and normal thing, is this such a case where I am unable to do so in a controlled and orderly manner?
* **Chaos in general** - Am I simply desiring chaos? Has my life became tame and orderly that I subconsciously and purposely start fires? 
  
All of these are big questions, so it might take me a while to come up with reasonable answers to all of them.

# Needing to unwind

Work gets stressful, and I do get heavily involved in the stresses of work. Due to my somewhat individualistic nature, I take many successes and failures personally.

Due to the prior mentioned [5 year plan](/ambitions/2022/01/12/5-year-plan.html) of no longer worrying, I've forced myself to remain calm and sensible a number of times already, and it's only February. 

My brain, for whatever reason, is wired to keep on coming up with new ideas and to get excited about them. I don't mind as I find the entire process to be a fun and exciting creative-thinking exercise, but it has never been helpful to do without any concrete output, and now I'm specifically warding myself against it.

Compared to trying to frantically come up with random business ideas and expecting them to work, I want to now try and write about it in this blog. It will help us in two ways, namely to write things down and action it in a healthy manner (no stress or pondering thoughts required) and also helps me in writing every day, which would hopefully lead to greater readability of what I'm writing. 

In my business cases, I won't really outline a lot of smaller stuff, but instead the general ideas and essence that I'm trying to capture, and how to go about it.

If you are reading this, and take the idea, and execute it, and make billions of dollars; then that's great! I have made my mark on the world. But the chances of that happening are slim, and so I can leave this here to be worked on and improved at a later date. Perhaps after 5 years of mulling it over, I will have enough work to go off in creating many businesses. Who knows. 

# Ecological packaging

There is a need for ecological packaging products in our supply chains. During the pandemic I've been somewhat forced to order a number of products online, shipped by amazon and other places, that have awful packaging. The packaging is usually bad in a myriad of ways:

* Excessive use of glues, glues paper to plastic (making both un-recyclable).
* Plastic, when paper/cardboard would have done fine.
* No clear instructions on how to recycle

This could be seen as a suitably sized hole that covers a real problem here with logistics and waste. Suppose if there was an ecological pressure applied to use better packaging resources. This could be a packaging wholesaler that only sells eco packaging on bulk, and then has the information required to allow for the recycling of that packaging. 

It could be taken a step further with using the eco packaging as a directory of companies that are working towards positive outcomes. There are general network effects and "self-marketing" that works to provide a positive feedback loop.

## Competition

- Other packaging companies.

## Pressure

- Green groups for not being green enough.
- Infiltration from non-green groups to muddy waters.

## Business Metrics

### Customers
- B2B, so target customers are other businesses that sell and move things
- Online presence / tutorials for consumers to recycle and learn how to manage waste. (get points?)

### Costs
- Getting stock
- Creating content (if required)

### Revenue
- Selling stock

Coming up with more unfeasible ideas, this time something from my old job: an electronics online retailer. This business keeps coming back to me because it's something that I know how to do in a way. I have enough understanding of electronics and the process of being an online retailer, that it's annoying to try and avoid doing it.

# Electronic store techno emporium

The general idea is that it's just an electronics e-commerce store; but as I've been in the business before, I know a little more of what people want, and so I feel confident in my ability to provide more services that people want.

When it comes to electronics, someone always provides things cheaper. The distinguishing feature is actually to do with the supporting materials: things like technical drawings, manuals, source code. I have seen some stores do this well, and others not so much.

Additionally to that, having tutorials and projects that include the component isa good idea; in a way that it shows how the device can be used. This is something that would take up a large majority of the time in the business, but it is content that would be needed to be able to distinguish from other stores.

Consider if there was a membership into a project group, for instance, then that would assist in developing a system that returns the customer to the store and keeps them within arms reach of the marketing department; it would also provide the customer with access to many other likeminded people and projects that are happening.

## Competition

- Other electronics store
    - The idea is they're just not doing a great job. Products need to have the uses and information around them, to the point where it 
      inspires further confidence in what to do with the product.
- Amazon / China undercut
    - These generally aren't provided with the same level of detail and support

## Metrics

- Products sold
- Members in project groups

### Customers

- Electronics people who want to build things.

### Costs

- Stock product
- Creating content and projects
- Community moderation

### Revenue

- Selling stock, kits, project books.

## Concerns

I don't actually like this that much, electronics can produce so much waste, and there's an endless stream of people who would buy things and not do anything with them. I see that as an "ecological-dark-pattern" in some way and doesn't gel well with me. The real path-to-solution with this is to actually look at ways we can reduce and reuse e-waste, but to do it in a way that is useful to technologists.

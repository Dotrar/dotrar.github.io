I've been using a bullet journal for about 2 months now, after being introduced to it in [bullet journalling for software developers]().
I tried a few of the suggestions in the blog post, but after a while I can see trends in what I enjoy using, and what I don't enjoy using.

All in all, this is a bit of a review and guide on what I've found works for me in regards to bullet journalling, and what doesn't. Hopefully some of this might be useful to you, and you might be able to spin off and remix what I've done to make your own style of bullet journalling (be sure to tell us about it in the comments if you do).

## Bullet Journalling Method

Firstly let's talk about what a bullet journal is. Bullet jounalling is a system or process whereby you write down all notes into a single destination. Largely this is things such as "daily todo lists" but can also include journals, misc-notes, shopping lists, and so on.

I've found some things work in it well, but suprisingly some things like "project planning" doesn't work (atleast for me and how I'm doing things) - More on that later.

There's a nice short video on bullet journalling [here]() if you want to give it a quick watch.

## Starting a journal

Thankfully I had a Leuchtturm1917 journal lying around. I do believe in the idea of "items of significance" should be of decent quality, otherwise you won't value the diary significantly enough to use or look after it.

Doing as the "bullet journalling system" says, we set up an index page at the front, a 6-month view, and the monthly view, along with the todo items for today. I'll go over each of these in details in terms of what I've done and how I've found it.

## Parts of a Journal
### 6-month spread ("Future Log")

This is pretty handy spread, Generally anything that is "we should do this next month or so" goes onto this spread as a bit of a todo item. When the month rolls around, you add those todo items to the monthly spread. 

I've found that this works nicely, but my november almost filled out in capacity during september, let alone october. I think I've worked a solution to this in the next section about monthly spreads.

Generally, if this is for high level concepts, you wouldn't want to break tasks down too much. The space is too thin to break out a level of details; the details should perhaps go in the monthly spread.

### Monthly spread view

Monthly spread I've changed from what the original post was talking about. I still use the 30 days down the left hand side, but I've split the right page to be both this-month and next-month like so:

### Daily todolist

The real meat of the substance comes from the daily to do lists which looks like this:

Generally I try to focus on these bits every morning and night, almost like a daily habit of brushing your teeth. There's two positive feelings I get from this every day:

* *The morning good feeling of seeing what to do and planning out the chaos*
* *The night good feeling of ticking items off the list, and planning for tomorrow*

Obviously each daily "checkout" of the journal also involves adding information to other parts if I come across them; I also try and make sure that I have my journal close by wheever I am, so if anything does come up, I can just write that into the journal at any time, and not lose it for later.

This is probably the most critical part of the journal system - Making sure that it's close by and easy to write into. Thoughts and ideas will be easily lost if they are not added to the journal then-and-there when you come across them.

This also brings us to the next part of the journal, which is the fiddly-bits and "random lists" that I come across.

### Random lists, fiddly bits.

I've tried to write out a few things in the "random" pages;

* Movies to watch with the wife
* Books to read
* Posts to write ( this is one of them!)
* Reasons to write, ways to find friends, my interests as an adult.

Anything that generally fits the "list" format works pretty well. I've also tried to write general prospectives of some projects and what purpose they serve (more on projects later).

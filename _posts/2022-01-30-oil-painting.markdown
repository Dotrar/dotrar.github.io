Next up, oil painting. I was excited to get into this one early because I have painted before and seem to enjoy it, although I wasn't sure how long the setup would be to get into it. My first result after dusting off the brushes and firing up a Bob Ross video ([Peaceful Reflections, S15E4, if you were wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYuH4Ilqdhs)).

My lovely wife actually bought me the easel as my birthday present, which was a good prompt to get into it and take things seriously (wouldn't want her to be buying me junk I never use).

# Learning to do things properly

One thing that I came across, in looking to revive my oil painting desires, is looking the problem of cleaning up the oils and paints, and keeping things clean and pristine.

Cleanliness is more of an issue when we're staying in a small rental, and we have small birds that love to fly around and land on things.

The brushes I had are old and caked on with old paint that I never dealt with properly. Infact, a lot of things I used to do was really bad; so I'm trying to pay attention to how I treat my things now. 

I was very tempted to spend almost $150 on new brushes, oils and things, to say "I'll look after things properly this time!" but after hovering over the buy button, I realised that i didn't have to. It's part of learning when you deal with the mess you've got, rather than trying to always replace with the new and the clean. The brushes I have are fine and it produced the painting in the image above. If, after this experiement is over and I find that I enjoy painting that I want to take it on full time, then I'll get proper brushes and oils and other things. But for now, the dingey brushes and paints I have will do just fine.

# Oil painting as a hobby

Anyway, it's off to a good start I think; Like other hobbies, I'm aiming to be able to atleast mark off about 3 hours a week. Each painting I try and do in about an hour, so it means 2 or 3 paintings a week. Might be a little tough with the slow speed of oil paint drying but I'll try and find a way.

## Mid-month update (2021-02-06) 

There's a very large uptake time when I don't have the right equipment, so I've settled to buy some safflower oil and some nice canvas boards. This can reduce some of the setup time and help with intermixing hobby and work, but it means I'm waiting a little while before the equipment comes in. 

I did try and do some painting without the products, but unless you're spending a whole day into cleaning the brushes while you do it, it becomes a bit unmanageable to pick-up-put-down again and again. I'll try it with the more reasonable equipment and see how much easier it becomes. So far, I only have one painting, and I'm one week in. So the rate of work is a bit slow.

## Assessment of the hobby

I'll update this post progressively through the weeks to keep updated with my progress, in amongst other blog posts that I try to do.

Like always, the requirements that I'm marking against:

- How quickly can I "jump into" it?
- How big of a time sink is it?
- Do I actively enjoy doing it?

I'll update this post later with more information (and photos) when they come.

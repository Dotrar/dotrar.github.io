Next up, oil painting. I was excited to get into this one early because I have painted before and seem to enjoy it, although I wasn't sure how long the setup would be to get into it. My first result after dusting off the brushes and firing up a Bob Ross video ([Peaceful Reflections, S15E4, if you were wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYuH4Ilqdhs)).

My lovely wife actually bought me the easel as my birthday present, which was a good prompt to get into it and take things seriously (wouldn't want her to be buying me junk I never use).

# Learning to do things properly

One thing that I came across, in looking to revive my oil painting desires, is looking the problem of cleaning up the oils and paints, and keeping things clean and pristine.

Cleanliness is more of an issue when we're staying in a small rental, and we have small birds that love to fly around and land on things.

The brushes I had are old and caked on with old paint that I never dealt with properly. Infact, a lot of things I used to do was really bad; so I'm trying to pay attention to how I treat my things now. 

I was very tempted to spend almost $150 on new brushes, oils and things, to say "I'll look after things properly this time!" but after hovering over the buy button, I realised that i didn't have to. It's part of learning when you deal with the mess you've got, rather than trying to always replace with the new and the clean. The brushes I have are fine and it produced the painting in the image above. If, after this experiment is over and I find that I enjoy painting that I want to take it on full time, then I'll get proper brushes and oils and other things. But for now, the dingey brushes and paints I have will do just fine.

# Oil painting as a hobby

Anyway, it's off to a good start I think; Like other hobbies, I'm aiming to be able to atleast mark off about 3 hours a week. Each painting I try and do in about an hour, so it means 2 or 3 paintings a week. Might be a little tough with the slow speed of oil paint drying but I'll try and find a way.

## Mid-month update (2021-02-06) 

There's a very large uptake time when I don't have the right equipment, so I've settled to buy some safflower oil and some nice canvas boards. This can reduce some of the setup time and help with intermixing hobby and work, but it means I'm waiting a little while before the equipment comes in. 

I did try and do some painting without the products, but unless you're spending a whole day into cleaning the brushes while you do it, it becomes a bit unmanageable to pick-up-put-down again and again. I'll try it with the more reasonable equipment and see how much easier it becomes. So far, I only have one painting, and I'm one week in. So the rate of work is a bit slow.

## Update (2021-02-12) - Not fun, but not painting's fault

Morale is low; I was able to paint today, but it is a bit slow going and a bit rough to try and fit it in. I got my "needed components" (safflower oil and canvas boards) and they're good, but it definitely makes things a little more fiddly.

Perhaps it's also due to some of the stresses of the week: I've been trying to sit down and paint for a while, and it's something I put in my [new organiser](/blog/2022/02/11/amazing-marvin-and-the-list-of-time.html) so that it stares me down; I haven't been lazily avoiding it though. Things just get busy in my life, and I was in the support seat these past two weeks, which have really taken the "external time" out from me.

([Ocean Breeze, S10E05](https://www.twoinchbrush.com/painting/ocean-breeze)). Perhaps another part of not enjoying this run was the fact that I've sort of been painting something new; I learnt a new technique of how to do waters, which has been very nice, but like anything new, there's always a bit of a struggle and frustration with it. The rock was also something that I couldn't do, as I have new paints and new mediums, nothing was quite working out the way I wanted it to. The hard canvas boards push against the knife (which was also new - and I didn't know how to hold properly.) meaning that rather than blotching on some jaggered rocks, it would scrape away the paint and reveal the cloth mesh canvas underneath. 

Every painting is going to be an opportunity to learn something new, so I've got to be able to process these sorts of things. I think I am able to handle these things, more generally, but perhaps just frustration at the fiddiliness got to me this time around. I don't know how I'd be able to cope with a child running around, and still living in a rental house.

Another difficulty seemed to have been the size of everything; I think oil painting is one medium that really works to have bigger paintings, rather than small; oil is largely a thick medium, and to be able to flow it around and move the way you want it to involves having a large amount of space to move and dance around. 

A little ridge of paint on the canvas looks much bigger on a smaller canvas.

## Assessment of the hobby

- As of the end of February, I had 2 paintings for the whole month, and a commission for one. 
- The setup, leave, teardown was hard to balance my life as it is currently.
- Not as stop/start as I would have liked. There was too much anxiety with leaving it out so the birds could get to it, or someone could knock it over into the rental apartment's walls, etc.
- Does require a big easel to be set up constantly in the study, and our apartment is a bit too small to have this corner taken up for the whole month (and yet only produce 2 paintings.)
  
  
### How quickly can I jump into it

Kind of not quickly; The setup and packdown times are rather large, and it's difficult to just "leave the paint lying about" as birds or other things can get into it. There is perhaps better methods of storage for the intermediate process: when I'm juggling between painting and work for instance, but at the moment that seems a little out of reach.

There's probably half an hour to setup, hour to paint, and hour to pack down; leading to a large chunk of time being used in the day to day; If we had a bit more space and I could leave a corner of the apartment to "the painting area" with no birds or similar getting into it, it could probably work out alright. But there's definitely a balance to be had when trying to factor in space and time.

### How big of a time sink is it?

Aside from the setup and packdown as above? It's actually fairly OK in this regard. If I can leave brushes around; leave the wet paint out; mull over some ideas and things; the painting works out to be a great hobby. But preparation and being able to leave it alone is key, and with having two pet cockatiels around, there's no chance I'll be able to leave it alone.

### Do I actually enjoy doing it? 

Yes, I do find the process rewarding and somewhat engaging. It's a nice hobby but I don't think I'm currently in the right place for it, in my life.


## Final words

It's a great hobby, but not for my life as it is right now. Once things get quiet again I should be able to pick it up and take off with it, but for now I need to keep a bit of mobility and minimialism in what I do.

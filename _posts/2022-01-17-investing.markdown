I've chosen "Investing" as my hobby for January; The month is almost over when I decided to take up the 11 hobbies project, and I figured it would be a good thing to try and set up - if i can - early in the year, so that I can keep a track of it and follow it loosely throughout the year.

With all the hobbies I'm doing in this project, I want to assess the hobby itself on a few key criteria:

- How quickly can I jump into it? 
- How big of a time sink is it?
- Do I actively enjoy doing it?

To mark the hobby as "sufficiently attempted" I would have:

- Invested at least 3 hours a week into the hobby.
- Written a blog article (here's one for investing!).
- Have atleast one outcome of the hobby; In the case of investing, I would like to own shares in atleast one company.

# Reading the book of value

Currently, I'm reading a book called the book of value, and it's very informative in the investing process. Investing is both a science and an art, and I'd argue a little more on the art and gambling side of it; no one can predict the future, just as no one can say what a piece of art truly means - there can only be educated guesses and interpretations. 

Looking at investing as a hobby is intriguing. The use of numbers and calculations mixed with the rhetoric and interpretation skills is akin to some sort of mystical alchemy. Some might approach it fully as science and subject it to mathematical formulas, others might take it purely as chance or poetic interpretation of what's said in each annual and quarterly reports. I'd argue that neither is enough, and one needs to apply a mix of approaches. 

The book talks about how to approach investing sensibly, and how important cognitive biases comes into play when looking at things to invest in. Emotions very often run high, and it's important to be practical and sensible about what decisions you're making. 

To remedy these high emotions and cognitive biases, the book uses a "null hypothesis" approach to refute a positive assumption (ie: "this is a good investment") - as you're much more likely to find true information and have to confront reality, rather than the positive-hype-train that can occur when approaching a decision from the opposite end, (ie: keep finding more and more information as to why this is a good idea - which is how hype trains start more often than not.)

I'm half way through the book already, and it's possible that the investing hobby resolves to just read this one book. I would like to have a shot in the share of atleast one company however, to say that I've done it, and I'd like that share not to be through services such as raiz or another fund-like service.

# Investing with ethics

Given my ethical mindset (supported and encouraged wholeheartedly by my wife) I am opting to invest ethically in terms of environmental and some societial concerns. My main interests are in waste and recycling; so for that, my first stock pick is going to be in a battery recycling plant being built in WA. 

Other than recycling, I'd probably be looking at some fintech, logistics, and services. Of which I'm not entirely certain on; I'll have to look some things up. 

One bit of advice I heard last night, about investing ethically, is to invest in the future you want. So for that, I'll be staying away from fast(false) food, vice/sin stocks, gambling, etc.

# Placing the trade

So I've put in two orders for the same stock, around $1000 worth. A small amount, but one I'm fairly comfortable with. There's a little bit of excitement in me as I'm waiting for the order to go through, but I've got to remember to keep my senses. It's a garden bed that I put the investment in, and wait to see how far it grows. I'm not interested in doing day-trading or otherwise; I must simply make a choice and ride it out.

The company I picked has good ideas about it, and is ecologically minded, which fits in with both my ethics and market desires. It should bode well for me, but I am understanding that the market is chaos, and can cause loss. A more conservative approach is warranted; but I wanted to be a little more forward thinking than just sitting on stable-whales. It's not conservation that is the goal, but expansion with minimal losses.

# Investing  as a hobby

And so, these are my thoughts as I do it. I will most likely edit this post as time moves on and I get more experienced with the hobby; hopefully this should provide enough of a one-stop-shop of information in terms of how the half a month of investing has gone for me. 

The initial feelings is that, while it's fun, it's a job. You've got to sink a lot of research into it in order to be fruitful. Although I do find it inspiring to see and read about what some companies are doing.

## How quickly can I jump into it?

It's fairly ephemerial. I can just bring up <https://businessnews.com.au> or otherwise and get information fairly quickly about anything. In terms of finding a stock, it's just something I think about googling and coming up with ideas; build a bit of a short list of companies that I like, and then do research on those companies. There's no real yardstick to measure the action by: "not now hun, I'm investing" - it's just an ever-lasting thing on the side of your todo list.

## How big of a time sink is it?

And for that reason, the time sink becomes rather large; Even just reading the book of value takes up a bit of my time, and having to sort through a lot of investor speak on annual reports, calculating the effectiveness of the company, etc etc, all tallies up to a whomping amount of time that is hard to juggle. It could be done piecemeal (in between other things) but it's a long slog. Emotionally it's a little wild to want to check the stocks and the news all the time, but with my style of investing "in the long run," there's a degree of needing to sit back. It's a hard balance to make.

> Investing is about time in the market, not timing the market.

## Do I actively enjoy doing it?

Researching and finding out more information is incredibly fun, in my mind, as I love to see what's out there and what's getting done. I'm a huge supporter of capitalism (something to write about) and I find it so fascinating that companies out there do things. I actually do enjoy it quite a lot, but I don't enjoy the time sink it takes. Perhaps that's just a part of my endless worrying about things that i shouldn't be worried about.

It will be interesting to see how the other hobbies go too, and whether they suffer the same fate. With a lot of things going on in life, one needs to make time for themselves, but do I find investing to be sufficiently "me" time? probably not. The other hobbies like painting and drawing might be meditative, and thus relax me further, making the time sink an investment in its own right. 

All in all, a good use of time, if I wasn't already doing everything else.

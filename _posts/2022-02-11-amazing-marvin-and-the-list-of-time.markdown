In my efforts to get more ontop of things, I've been bouncing back and forward between some todo-list applications, and even had thoughts of developing my own.
A common trait or concern that I come across with is trying to find the "perfect" application, whatever that might mean.
Eventually I realised that the use of a todo-application and the system that it proposes comes down to the ability to *adhere* to that process.

> Systems are only useful when they are adhered to.

So I've stuck myself with `Amazing Marvin` for now, which does a pretty decent job, and I've learnt to deal with the inevitable hiccup in the workflow. 
These are just aspects of life after all.

I'm still sticking with the [bullet journal](/thoughts/2021/10/26/organising.html) which is going well enough, but with modifications on how I use it. I've found reasonable success in this process, and the last few *days* have been ok in regards to following whatever plan I might have.

This leaves us with 3 things to look at:

1. My calendar, for important meetings, events, and appointments
2. Marvin, for general todo items and execution strategy
3. Bullet journal, for thoughts, ideas, things to-do when I'm not at the computer.

My only real concern is the requirement to be infront of the computer for the morning-day-planning that I like to do. I could probably rectify this by making use of the printed-lists feature or by using the e-ink reader, which is probably worthwhile to do anyway, but Marvin does not (yet) have the "plan my day" section for mobile app usage.

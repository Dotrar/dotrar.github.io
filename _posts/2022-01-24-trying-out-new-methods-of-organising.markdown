The following is a bit of stream of conscientious that I haven't yet developed, but I am still thinking about these ideas. 

Finding a way to organise notes and things is something that is a neverending process for me. There's 3 main aspects what I'm trying to capture:

- Random things "todo" that come up as I think about them (* ie: I must do this later)
- Articles and pictures and things that I want to do someday. (* ie: read this article, picture of x to do it later)
- What I should be doing today. (* Daily organising) with enough leniency that failures don't compound.

I've tried a couple of different options; Todoist was a good contender for a while but fell by the wayside, Now trying my bullet-journal, but it's not *always* with me.

Due to the nature of how.. varied.. thoughts and tasks are, I've kind of left it to 

1. I've got to be able to collect and see my todo list, where-ever I am
2. I've got to be able to think and process my thoughts, usually through pen to paper and distraction free. 
3. I want to be able to collect things to organise. - articles, ideas, and be able to sort through them. Categorise them into places.
4. I want to have good habits force upon me slightly. 

I can concede straight away that (4.) is too opinionated to be of any use to anyone.

## Conversational Workflow

The issue with "conversational" style is that it doesn't fit the human need for emotion and pleasantries when dealing with bots and automated assistants.

Considering something like "Hey Google" - there's a too-human element to it that requires pleasantries in order for it to flow: "can you please turn the music down"

It's not to say that the pleasantries are bad, but it's harder to come across when *typing*. As it takes longer to type out "p-l-e-a-s-e" than to just type commands that we're so used to doing on the computer anyway.

## 3 part workflow

1. Collect
2. Organise
3. Do

### Collecting

Should be as minimal as possible when it comes to barriers to entry. I should be able to put in information seemingly from anywhere; Sharing photos, sharing links, in the middle of vimming.

ie:
```
read https://asdfasdf.com
```

### Organising

There's two parts to organising, the `Action` and the `Schedule` -- The action refers to what is to be done with it: are you to post this image elsewhere? or are you trying to analyse the image. Read the text or summarise and critique it? 

Then there's the schedule; When would you do it? The action would indicate an amount of time that it might take to do something; critiquing something is a lot longer than to just simply read and make notes of.

### Do

Then the todo list is laid out for you, as each item has the time it's meant to be done, and the estimated time of completion.

## Notes and other things

Then there's the PKM side of things - where to store all this information so that it's easily retrievable? If a workflow might be that I came across an article on e-bikes; I want to be able to read the article, and perhaps take some notes. Those notes should be linked into my PKM, so that if I come across a task like 'buy an ebike' - the link should be there, to find my previous information.

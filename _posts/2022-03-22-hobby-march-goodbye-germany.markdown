The hobby for March was to be German, but throughout this month I've found that I don't want to do it as much as I had thought I wanted to.

## Success through failure 

While this month (so far) has been a bit of a stressed one, I've been trying to find a way to sit down and do something like 30 minutes to an hour of German language. I've only been able to do this once, which was last night, as preparation for this blog post, as I thought that I should open atleast one book before I cast German aside for good.

I started to write a post at the start of the month (01-03-22), and again towards the early weeks (14-03-22) but both attempts just ended up flat and I couldn't tell why. I am soon to be very busy with a newborn, and I'm doing good amount of work, but I still think that if i want to do something, I'd make time to do it.

And fundamentally, it comes down to me realising, throughout this month, that I'm no longer attached to the language. My prior reasons for liking it were purely romanticism of the German peoples, language, and culture, which has since evaporated.

I still very much *like* German and Germany, but not enough to learn it at a hefty pace. This might change if my wife was to learn it or I have some more people to talk to, but currently it's just me and some discord people that can only give me the ability to experience and practise the language.

## Dissatisfaction in similarity 

In reading some short stories in the language (as I did last night) - I've found that the language is nice, but I feel like it's too similar to English to really capture my attention. This would be the same for all of the romance / latin-alphabet languages (I've never been fond of Spanish nor French) and after experiencing a bit of Chinese and Korean, I'm more drawn to the *cryptic writing* that they provide. It, to me, feels like enough of a new experience that it captures my imagination, much the same as the child's pigpen writing system caught my imagination when I was younger.

## Realisations of the difficulties in language

One thing I did realise throughout this month is that learning a language is hard, even aside from the motivations aspects of it. 

When learning a language, you must be able to take in cultural aspects, absorb content from many different sources, and more importantly have opportunities to chat with others in the TL.

In all of my experiences, the only time I've been able to talk to others in German is when I'm talking with one of my neighbours (who I don't have lots of conversations with) and when I'm flirting with co-workers and co-students from Germany ( which are usually 95% female for some reason) - I seldom meet any German males, let alone ones I can get along with or have common interests, etc.

Chinese is a different variety, as I have Chinese friends, and it is more prevalent in Australia to have Chinese nationals around. Any work involving shipping and imports will involve Chinese people, and generally, there's good Chinese business opportunities.

# Restructuring the next habit: April Chinese

This month is almost over, but I've gotten the benefit from it already; I've come to terms with acknowledging that I don't want to invest the time in learning German in my life as it is currently. 

Perhaps it will change in the future and there would be a more specific reason to learn German; Perhaps I would get a job working with more German people, or dealing with German technology, etc, or my wife might want to learn German, or we might teach our kid German.
But those times aren't for now, and I can finally stop dragging the *"I'm learning German"* nameplate that I've kept since my highschool era.

But I have realised that Chinese is a language that I'm interested in, and I've also realised the effort involved in learning a new language (especially from scratch). So while I'll have a newborn during April, I'll use that time to practise and perfect a language that I can use in the day to day with talking with my Chinese friends.

Korean is still a language that I have on my radar, but after this month I've been very much re-assessing it. Do I want to know this language? Is there a specific reason or way I can practise it? Does it capture my imagination?

I think the answer to most of these is "yes in some way" - but I'll push it down the line to another month so that I have time to get into a bit of a balance with my baby as well as judge these questions in earnest.

Doing Chinese in April will give me time to see and experiment how much I like language learning for the sake of language learning. Naturally I can get by without learning Chinese, but it's an interesting skill that I feel the desire to pick up and use in daily interactions with my friends.
